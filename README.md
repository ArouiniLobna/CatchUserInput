As start and to save time for this test, i have used code bootstrapping tool called react-boilerplate which help save building the project base time. This tool set upby default a Redux store and attach the reducer to it.

To fetch the Apis, axios or fetch will do same effecient work as i am building a small app. However, when building bigger apps, it is better to use axios and will be using it within the test as well.

ASSEMPTIONS:


DEVELOPMENT PROCESS (spent !!):
1. build connected component that will hanlde th the api call and messages related and get the response as well.
